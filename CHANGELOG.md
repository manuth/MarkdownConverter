## MarkdownConverter v5.0.0
### Breaking
  - Renamed a few settings  
    Have a look at this table to see what the new settings are called like now:
    | Old Name                                                | New Name                                       |
    | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.Template`            | `markdownConverter.Document.Template`          |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.DefaultStyles`       | `markdownConverter.Document.DefaultStyles`     |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.HighlightStyle`      | `markdownConverter.Document.HighlightStyle`    |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.StyleSheetInsertion` | `markdownConverter.Assets.StyleSheetInsertion` |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.StyleSheets`         | `markdownConverter.Assets.StyleSheets`         |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.ScriptInsertion`     | `markdownConverter.Assets.ScriptInsertion`     |
    | `markdownConverter.Document.Design.Scripts`             | `markdownConverter.Assets.Scripts`             |

## MarkdownConverter v3.0.0
### General
Hey Guys!

It's time for another big update once more, because I finally managed it to stuff all features I ever wanted into MarkdownConverter!  
Though I'm still not that satisfied about the document-chaining feature but I'll find a way to improve this feature for sure.

Lots of things have changed in background. First I set up my own [Drone CI Server](https://drone.nuth.ch) which allows me to automatically check, test and also publish my projects.

MarkdownConverter is the very first project I'm trying to run using my CI-Server so please don't be mad if anything fails or something. 😅

Thanks to @damgot it's now possible to override the `markdownConverter.Document.HeaderTemplate` and `markdownConverter.Document.FooterTemplate`-settings by setting the `HeaderTemplate` and/or `FooterTemplate` front-matter attribute to a path to a file to load the template from.

The path is either relative to the workspace-folder, if present, or to the directory containing the document.

Another change is that my project now is compressed and merged into nearly a single file using [`browserify`](https://npmjs.com/package/browserify). This might make my extension run even faster.

### Changes
  - Provide the functionality to override the header- and footer-template
  - Fix a few issues
    - The margin- and toc-settings are now loaded correctly
    - Self-contained html-files now can be converted on single-threaded environments
  - Improve performance
    - MarkdownConverter is now compressed using browserify.
  - Improve developer experience
    - The project is now built using gulp
  - The project is now automatically tested on [manuth's Drone CI](https://drone.nuth.ch/manuth/MarkdownConverter/)
  - Update all dependencies

## MarkdownConverter v2.0.0
### General
It's about time to publish another more verbose release.
This time I put lots of effort into `MarkdownConverter` to finish some features I wanted to add for a long time.

One of the most notable things I think you might find very useful is
that the destination-path is now fully customizable using the `DestinationPattern`-option.
The `DestinationPath` and `DestinationOrigin`-options have been dropped in favor of said option.

You might want to set the `DestinationPattern` to whatever pattern to save your documents to, like, for example:
```json
{
  "markdownConverter.DestinationPattern": "${workspaceFolder}/output/${dirname}/${basename}.${extension}"
}
```

Also, I finally added an option for converting all files at once and one for chaining all documents together.
These features make great use of the `DestinationPattern`-option as this makes very clear where to store converted files.

Another pretty nice thing is that now every single command reports each progress that's made.
This makes it easier to you to check whether the conversion's still running or what's causing trouble.

Continue reading to see what else changed.

Thank you guys for using `MarkdownConverter` and for keeping me motivated!
You guys are the best! 🎉

### Breaking Changes
  - Added the `DestinationPattern`-option for specifying a pattern for resolving the destination-path  
    You can use following epressions in the `DestinationPattern`:
    - `${workspaceFolder}`:  
      Either the path to the `workspace`, if any, or the directory which contains the document.
    - `${dirname}`:  
      The relative path from the `${workspaceFolder}` to the directory which contains the document.
    - `${basename}`:  
      The name of the document-file without extension.
    - `${extension}`:  
      The file-extension of the destination-datatype.
    - `${filename}`:  
      The name of the document-file with its original extension.
  - Dropped `DestinationPath` and `DestinationOrigin` in favor of `DestinationPattern`

### Other Changes
  - Prevented port-collisions when converting multiple files at once
  - Fixed the threading-issues by automatically disabling sandboxed mode if it fails  
    Special thanks to [@jkhsjdhjs](https://github.com/jkhsjdhjs) for reporting and also fixing this issue
  - Improved the exception-handling
  - Improved the stability of the code
  - Added a command `Convert All Documents` for converting all markdown-documents in the current workspace at once
  - Added a command `Chain All Documents` for chaining all markdown-documents in the current workspace and convert them afterwards
  - Added a fix for loading the VSCodes `markdown-it`-instance  
    Sadly VSCodes `markdown-it`-parser can only be loaded once a markdown-file has been opened.
    Thus a temporary, empty markdown-file will be opened once a conversion has started
    if the VSCode-parser has not been loaded yet.
  - Provided the functionality to convert to self-contained html-files
  - Added progress-report to every command

  - Added a prompt for specifying a `DestinationPath` which is displayed when `MarkdownConverter` the `DestinationPath`, none or more than 1 workspace-folders are opened and the name of the file is untitled
